# 19. === New DA VINCI Warning that does not apply. Requirements to things that do not exist (version 0.1.0 was the initial ballot version and tickets did not exist, SubscriptionTopic does not exist in R4; Added a link on this page to the R5 SubscriptionTopic instead), Da Vinci approved on 8/25 ===
