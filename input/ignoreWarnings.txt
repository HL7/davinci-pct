# Have raised Jira FHIR-34371 per Lloyd's request. See Zulip from Lloyd: https://chat.fhir.org/#narrow/stream/179252-IG-creation/topic/Unsupported.20code.20systems

Found a reference to a CodeSystem (http://terminology.hl7.org/CodeSystem/processpriority) where a ValueSet belongs

# Dicussed on Zulip, should be a warning not an error: https://chat.fhir.org/#narrow/stream/179266-fhirpath/topic/FHIRPath.20asserting.20all.20references.20resources.20are.20in.20a.20Bundle

Reference is remote which isn't supported by the specified aggregation mode(s) for the reference (bundled)
