Instance: GFESubmitOperation
InstanceOf: OperationDefinition
Description: "This operation is used by an entity to submit one or multiple GFEs as a Bundle containing the GFE(s) and other referenced resources for processing. The only input parameter is the single Bundle resource with one or multiple GFE(s) - each of which is based on the Claim resource (along with other referenced resources). The only output is a url for subsequent polling per [async pattern](https://hl7.org/fhir/R5/async-bundle.html). If after polling the response is complete, then the result will either be a single Bundle with the AEOB - which is based on the ExplanationOfBenefit resource, (and other referenced resources) or an OperationOutcome resource indicating the AEOB will be sent directly to the patient and not to the provider."

Instance: GFERetrieveOperation
InstanceOf: OperationDefinition
Description: "This operation is used by an entity to retrieve a GFE Packet containing the GFE Bundle(s) and other referenced resources based on a GFE Coordination Task. There are no input parameters and the only output is a GFE Packet. If the context task is to a Coordinating Task, this will return the GFE Packet. If the context task is for a GFE Contributor Task, it returns the GFE Bundle, if present. If a GFE Bundle does not exist for an associated Contributor Task, in place of a GFE Bundle, a GFE Missing Bundle is provided (either directly in a response if the referenced task was a Contributor Task or inside the GFE Packet if the referenced task was a Coordinating Task.). This operation will only return GFE Bundles for GFE Contributor Tasks that have an appropriately attached GFE Bundle and a status of `completed`. All other Contributor Tasks that otherwise do not have a status of `rejected` or `cancelled` will have a GFE Missing Bundle included instead."
