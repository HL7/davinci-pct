### PCT IG Relation to other IGs
<h4>US Core</h4>
<p>This IG uses the Claim and ExplanationOfBenefit Resource as its primary resources. Reference Resources are Coverage, Patient, Practitioner, PractitionerRole, Organization and Location. Since the ExplanationOfBenefit and Coverage profiles are not included in US Core, there is no alignment requirement for these profiles. Patient, Practitioner, and Organization are US Core Profiles. Since these are supporting / reference profiles (rather than a focus profile) in this IG, the alignment with the US Core is on the content of these profiles, but not on the search parameters. </p>
