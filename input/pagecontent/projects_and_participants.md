### The Da Vinci PCT project
 Project participants have included major EHR vendors, payers, provider organizations, and others.  The first standard for trial use version of the specification was published in 2023 and the specification has undergone considerable testing at various Connectathons and has started to be picked up in pilot implementations since then. Further details about the project, including minutes of meetings can be found on the [project Confluence page](https://confluence.hl7.org/spaces/DVP/pages/116460399/Patient+Cost+Transparency+PCT).
