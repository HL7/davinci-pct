The following {{include.content}} relates to the GFE Coordination workflow and is marked as **DRAFT**. This content has not yet met the requisite level of testing to be balloted as trail-use. However, this part of the specification has been reviewed by the Da Vinci PCT open community of providers, payers, and health IT vendors and was determined to be at a sufficient level of development to be included in this publication for the purposes of soliciting feedback from, and enabling testing by, the larger implementation community with the intention of bringing the content related to the GFE Coordination workflow to full STU status in a future version.
Feedback is welcome and may be submitted through the [FHIR change tracker](http://hl7.org/fhir-issues) indicating "US Da Vinci Patient Cost Transparency (PCT)(FHIR)" as the specification.
